# MathIALatex
This is a template for IB students who wish to use LaTeX for their Math IA with some defaults built in.
---
This is a .sty file for those who take IB. It takes care of formatting things such as - 
- Margins
- Footnoted Full text Citations
- Figure and Graph enviorments 
- All figures and graphs treated as floats 
- Page count on title page (Excluding title page, Table of contents, and Bibliography)
- Hyperref for links 

I will likely add some packages to make it even easier to make pgfplots, tikz images, and tables. Regardless please feel free to let me know of any requests IB students will find helpful. This is my first project so would hope to improve it as much as possible!!
